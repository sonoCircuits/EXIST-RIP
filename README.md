# EXI[S]T: an adaption of Mannequins' RIP module.

Mannequins RIP module by Whimsical Raps is now [open source](https://github.com/whimsicalraps/RIP_DIY). EXI[S]T is an adaption thereof and can be configured in several ways. The name is a homage to Meng Qi's module "Please Exist".

## Modes of use

The main PCB – *the transformer board* – is meant to be mounted inside the case. The inputs and outputs can be connected in serveral ways. Any configuration of the listed options below is possible.

 
**Input option A:** <br> The inputs are conncted to the *transformer board* via 16 pin ribbon cable from the 1u EXI[S]T module. The 1u modules are available in Intellijel (12HP) and Pulplogic (10HP) format and house the input jacks, lift switch and an attenuating volume pot. <br>

**Input option B:** <br> An [Intelligel Mixup](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/mixup) module can be connceted directly to the *transformer board* via the molex 3pin output bus connector. This configuration makes the 1u module redundant and ground lift may be engaged directly on the transformer board with two jumpers.

**Output option A:** <br> TRS Jacks can be connected to the *transformer board* with wires via the "TRS" pads. <br>

**Output option B:** <br> The 6pin header can be connected either to an Intellijel [Audio Jack rev2 board](https://intellijel.com/shop/cases/7u-audio-jacks-board-v2) or an Intellijel [Stereo Line Out Jacks module](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/1u/stereo-line-out-jacks-1u) via 6 pin ribbon cable.

## Make you own

**PCBs:** All [eagle files](https://github.com/sonoCircuits/EXIST-RIP/tree/master/EXIST-EAGLE%20FILES) can be found in the repro in case you wish to have PCB's fabricated.

**BOM:** A build guide and BOM will follow, however the BOM is nearly identical to the original version.

Thanks to [Whimsical Raps](http://whimsicalraps.com) for designing RIP and making this possible by making the files open source and to Meng Qi for the name inspiration.
