# EXI[S]T: an adaption of Mannequins' RIP module.

Mannequins RIP module by Whimsical Raps is now open source.

EXI[S]T is an adaption for cases with audio jacks on the rear (e.g. DIY cases or Intellijel 7u cases).

There is one PCB and panel in 1u format (Intellijel and Pulplogic), which houses the input jacks, lift switch and a volume pot.

The second PCB – the transformer board – is meant to be mounted inside the case and is connected to the 1u module via 16pin ribbon cable.

The output TRS jacks are either connected with wires via pads or can be connected to an Intellijel Audio Jack rev2 board via 6pin ribbon cable.

Owners of an Intelligel Mixup module may connect it directly to the transformer board via the molex 3pin connector. This option makes the 1u module redundant and ground lift may be engaged directly on the transformer board.

You'll find all eagle files and gerbers in the repro in case you wish to have PCB's fabricated.

A build guide and BOM will follow, however the BOM is nearly identical to the original version.
