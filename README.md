# EXI[S]T: an adaption of Mannequins' RIP module.

Mannequins RIP module by Whimsical Raps is now ![open source]. (https://github.com/whimsicalraps/RIP_DIY) EXI[S]T is an adaption thereof and can be configured in several ways. The name is a homage to Meng Qi's module "Please Exist"

The main PCB – *the transformer board* – is meant to be mounted inside the case and the inputs and outputs can be connected in serveral ways.

**Outputs**

Option A: TRS Jacks can be connected to the transformer board with wires via the "TRS" pads.
Option B: The 6pin header can be connected to an Intellijel Audio Jack rev2 or a 


is connected to the 1u module via 16pin ribbon cable.

There is one PCB and panel in 1u format (Intellijel and Pulplogic), which houses the input jacks, lift switch and a volume pot.



Owners of an Intelligel Mixup module may connect it directly to the transformer board via the molex 3pin connector. This option makes the 1u module redundant and ground lift may be engaged directly on the transformer board.

You'll find all eagle files and gerbers in the repro in case you wish to have PCB's fabricated.

A build guide and BOM will follow, however the BOM is nearly identical to the original version.
